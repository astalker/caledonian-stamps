# Competitions

The Caledonian Philatelic Society runs a number of philatelic competitions to encourage members to develop research and upgrade the presentation of their collections. The competitions are geared towards both the new and also the experienced philatelist. It is an ideal opportunity for the less experienced collector to gain initial experience of what is required for competition and exhibiting.

Competitions are held on an annual basis. For each trophy a list of the winners is shown. Where there are missing years there were no entrants.

Many of the club's more eminent philatelists have gone on to win prizes at National and International level - club competition was their starting point. In addition to comments from the judge, fellow members will be pleased to provide advice, tips and encouragement. The rules of the various competitions are outlined below or can be obtained from the Secretary.

### Competition Rules
The following trophies are awarded to the winners of the Society's annual competitions. The entries for these competitions are judged by two ABPS accredited judges, who are not members of the Society. Entries are judged before the Competition night and feedback is provided to the entrants on that night. The criteria for each completion class is based on those of the Association of Scottish Philatelic Societies (ASPS) and more detail and extracts from ASPS rules and guidance on the requirements is shown under each trophy description.

## Julia MacLeod Trophy
Picture postcards depicting a subject or theme.

An exhibit can have a geographical (topographical) treatment, including for example illustrations from a place or an area. It can also be developed thematically. An event may be shown as a form of reportage, or the exhibit may have the photographer, the artist, or the printer as the topic. Original thinking and creativity may also lead to different treatments of an exhibit.

The size, shape and material of the Picture Postcards may vary. The emphasis is on the picture, and not on the use or philatelic peculiarities (if present). Picture Postcards may be unused or used (sent through a mail system). Unused Picture Postcards should have printed address lines, stamp box, or other such markings, showing that the item was intended to be sent without cover.

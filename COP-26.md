# COP 26

To mark the Climate Change Conference ‘COP26’, held in Glasgow from 31 October to 12 November 2021. One of our members, Andrew Black, designed a set of four postcards showing what Glasgow wouild be like in 2121 if sea levels continue to rise - very much tongue in cheek.
Royal Mail did not producce any special postmarks for the event. However, this was one way to help publicise the event, and our hobby.

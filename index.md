The door on Richmond Street opposite the Students' Union will always be open. To access the meeting room take the lift to floor 5. On leaving the lift turn immediately to the left and take the corridor across the top of the car park. At the end turn left and follow the corridor to room GH542.  

The syllabus is made up of a blended mixture of face-to-face meetings and ZOOM meetings - see Meetings Page for details.

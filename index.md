## 2023 - 2024 Session

The 2023 - 2024 session of the Caledonian Philatelic Society is all set to start. The first meeting is on the 5th of October 2023 at the usual venue in Strathclyde University. This year we are basically back to normal actual meetings with only one ZOOM meeting scheduled (in January). Joint meetings with Glasow Philatelic Society were very popular last year and 5 more are planned for thie session.There is the usual mix of displays by members and visiting guests plus the usual Bourse, Auction and Social Evening. It promises to be an exciting session with a good mix of themes over the course of the year.

## Access to meeting room 

As in previous years, meetings are held in the Graham Hills Building, Room GH542 at 7.30pm. Access is from Richmond Street and George Street - see the Location Page for directions. Due to changes in Strathclyde University control of access to buildings the door from George Street will be closed at 7pm and the door from the car park is via a key card. The door on Richmond Street opposite the Students' Union will always be open. To access the meeting room take the lift to floor 5. On leaving the lift turn immediately to the left and take the corridor across the top of the car park. At the end turn left and follow the corridor to room GH542.  

The syllabus is made up of a blended mixture of face-to-face meetings and ZOOM meetings - see Meetings Page for details.

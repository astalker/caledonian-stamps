Continuing restrictions on access to our normal meeting room in Strathclyde University mean we are continuing with virtual meetings using ZOOM. The first face-to-face meeting was successfully held on Februry 10th 2022 in the Renfield Centre and the next two face-to-face meetings will be held there on 10th March and on April 7th.

Meetings in the Renfield Centre will be held in the Kirk Lounge on the 1st Floor. There is a lift available  The room is booked from  6.00-9.30.  After setting up we will hold a small Bourse from 6.30 and meetings will begin between 7.15 and 7.30 as usual.  There is ample parking on Bath Street after 6pm or in the nearby NCP beside the Kings Theatre.  Public Transport is also available.

## SUMMER MEETINGS ## 

Three summer meetings have been arranged for:

17th  August 2023

14th September 2023

Meetings will be held in Anniesland Temple Church – 1pm open for 1:30pm start

The foramat is informal and will take the form of Show and Tell “ whatever you wish – one sheet or up to one board.  Boards will be available.

The summer meetings will be held in the rear hall of  Anniesland Temple Parish Church; the address is 869 Crow Road G13 1LE but the rear hall is best accessed off Glencoe Street (which is the first right turn after Anniesland lights as you head to Bearsden). There is a car park at the Church and street parking on Glencoe Street (please leave the car park for those with walking difficulties). Alternatively, you can park in Morrison’s Car Park for up to 3 hours (so plenty of choice)

## The syllabus for 2023 - 2024 will be added shortly. ##

### Kelvin Hall Open Days and Chinese New Year

### Social Evening
One of the highlights of recent years has been the Social Evening. The first Social Evening was held in 1986 on the SV Carrick. Over the years the Social Evening was held in a variety of different venues:

1986 – 1989 SV Carrick – Moored on Clyde Street, Glasgow

1990 – 1991 Kingspark Hotel, Rutherglen

1992 – 2008 The Wickets Hotel, Glasgow

2009 – 2019 The Hilton, Grosvenor, Glasgow

In recent years the annual competition prize winners were presented with their trophies.

Much needed funds for the Society were raised at the evening from a silent auction. This would be followed by a quiz ably compiled and compered by Ken Norris.

A souvenir postcard would be produced for each year – the card from the first Social Evening in 1986 is shown below.

The Social Evening was not held in 2020 or 2021 due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In previous years, on special occasions, there were Special Diners and one such was the Anniversary Dinner in the Charing Cross Hotel in March 1924

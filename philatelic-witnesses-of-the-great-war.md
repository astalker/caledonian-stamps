### Philatelic Witnesses of the Great War

In 2016 to celebrate the 110th Anniversary of the Caledonian Philatelic Society, the hosting of the Annual Congress of the Association of Scottish Philatelic Societies on April 15th and 16th 2016 and to add to the great public interest in the Centenary of the Great War of 1914 - 1919 the Society compiled and published a book entitled:

**“Philatelic Witnesses of the Great War”**

The book is designed for the reader to browse and find philatelic material that they may never have seen before and also to get an impression of how the Great War was portrayed through philatelic material. None of the material portrays the real horror and scale of devastation which is to some extent understandable as the authorities needed to encourage patriotism to keep up support for the war through propaganda and play down the horrors and futility of the war.

The content of the book was based on material from society member’s collections and so does not cover every aspect of the war or cover each topic to the same depth or in the same style but reflects individual member’s interests and collecting style.
Contents covered are:

* Views of the War in Postcards
* Personal Stories
* Internment Camps
* Fund Raising for the War Effort
* Patriotism and Propaganda
* Far Flung Places – Africa
* Far Flung Places – Falkland Islands
* Far Flung Places – Eastern Europe
* Aftermath and Consequences

This year's Congress, held in Renfrew in July was organized by the Caledonian Philatelic Society as part of our Centenary Celebrations. Apart from the organizing committee, some of our other members featured in the event. One of the opening displays was given by our member Bill Spalding and was devoted to "Laurel and Hardy". The ASPS Congress cover was used with a special handstamp at PCGB.

The Congress Medal for 2006 was awarded to our Secretary Ken Norris for his service to philately in Scotland.

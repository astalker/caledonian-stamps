## Forgery Collection

The Forgery Collection was established in February 1924 under the stewardship of Hugh Monro, the incumbent President.  Up until then the Society made donations to the forgery collection held by the Philatelic Congress of Great Britain.  The collection has been enhanced over the years by many donations and looked after by  J R Raeburn,  Donald Chisholm, James Merrylees, R Kerr, Bert Mendelsohn, Jim Fairbairn, Graham Hoey, Garry Buchanan , Alan Wishart and now by the current forgery warden Stewart Gardiner and it is available for consultation by members on request.

A photocopy of all fully written-up pages of the collection, which are listed below, resides in the library and is available at meetings to members.  These represent about 60% of the collection. The collection will be made much more accessible soon as all the fully written up pages are being scanned and will be available on CD to members.  This will greatly enhance its value to members.
The collection is not limited to forgeries as it also includes reprints, fakes and bogus stamps.

The collection contains some very scarce material including the scarce Mauritius reprints shown below.

### Stamp Collecting is for You

In 2020 to help promote and encourage interest in stamp collecting, the Caledonian Philatelic Society compiled and issued a set of booklets under the banner:

**“Stamp Collecting is for you”**

Four booklets were produced and were distributed by members to Philatelic Societies in the Glasgow area, libraries, museums and stamp shops. The objective was to foster interest in stamp collecting and to encourage joining a stamp club in the Glasgow area.

Four booklets were produced covering different aspects of stamp collecting and to show the diverse nature of stamp collecting:

* [Scottish Missionary Mail](pdfs/Scottish-Missionary-Mail.pdf)
* [Scottish Connection to New Zealand](pdfs/Scottish-Connection-to-NewZealand.pdf)
* [Butterflies and Moths](pdfs/Butterflies-and-Moths.pdf)
* [Scottish Botanists](pdfs/Scottish-Botanists.pdf)

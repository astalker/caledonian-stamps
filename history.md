1. [75th Anniversary](#75th-anniversary)

One of the UK's longest-running philatelic societies, Caledonian Philatelic Society was founded on 14 February 1906 when a group of stamp collectors met on the premises of Douglas, Cook & Co Stamp Dealers on Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, and made the decision to form a philatelic society. The group was initially known as the Junior Philatelic Society of Scotland, changing to its current name in 1930. Its first president was Sir John Ure Primrose, Glasgow's Lord Provost, and he continued as president until his death in 1923. On its 75th anniversary, the Society hosted the annual Congress of Scottish Philatelic Societies at Stirling University. One souvenir produced to mark the anniversary was a miniature sheet depicting a booklet pane with a St Andrews cross which was first printed in 1906, the year that the Society was formed. In its centenary year, the Society hosted the ASPS Congress at Perth; organised the Philatelic Congress of GB in Renfrew in July and gave an invited display to the Royal Philatelic Society London in November 2006. Two special evenings were included in the Syllabus when Past Presidents gave short displays to the members. The society has met at several Glasgow venues over the decades and currently meets weekly from early October to the middle of December and from early January to mid-March on the fifth floor of the Graham Hills Building, University of Strathclyde, George Street. The two thousand-five hundredth meeting of the Society was held on 13 October 2016.

### Caledonian Philatelic Society Centenary 1906 â€” 2006 Glasgow

City of leisure and learning, optimism, wealth, power, spirit and warmth.

In 1906 Glasgow, second city of the British Empire, was in the process of moving from horses to cars and from gas lamps to electricity. Industry in Glasgow was flourishing. The Clyde was a world centre for shipbuilding. Glasgow had a major university. One of its greatest teachers, Lord Kelvin, a revolutionary scientist and global communications pioneer, was in the last year of his illustrious life. A building programme was in full swing with 75 new schools (including Mackintosh's Scotland Street School) built. As a supplier of research and a skilled and educated workforce, Glasgow was a magnet for inward investment.

If Glasgow worked hard, it also played hard. Sport was important. And entertainment. At the Panopticon, a young Stan Laurel made his professional debut as an entertainer, the launch pad to an international career. Mackintosh's masterpiece School of Art was part completed. In that year too, Mackintosh and his wife moved into 6 Florentine Terrace, Glasgow, a house now recreated in Glasgow University's Hunterian Art Gallery.

Amidst this creative flurry, a new pursuit was also developing. Philately merged elements of sophisticated engineering, commerce, art, learning and leisure. As such it was ideally suited to this energetic city. In February 1906 a group gathered to form the Junior Philatelic Society - 100 years later that Society, now called the Caledonian Philatelic Society, is still going strong and is happy to host the 77th Congress of the Association of Scottish Philatelic Societies.

In the century which followed, Glasgow has been transformed. The city suffered decline when its shipbuilding, mining and heavy manufacturing industries lost their competitive edge in the post-war years. Glasgow, however, did not accept that decline was its fate and began to transform its economy to one based on knowledge, services, culture and tourism.

Glasgow has become a natural focal point for knowledge based industries. The city continues to develop innovative ways of using new technologies to drive economic growth for the benefit of its citizens and the Scottish economy. As part of its reinvention, the city has won many accolades: UK Garden Festival City 1988; European City of Culture 1990; British City of Architecture 1999; and most recently it was recognised as the world's 'Intelligent Community of the Year; 2004-5'.

The City has been well recognised by philately. Stamps featuring Glasgow, Glasgow events, Glasgow products and Glaswegians (including adopted ones) abound, issued by postal administrations around the world from St Lucia to Tuvalu. 2006 also marks 50 years of Europa stamps which have commemorated increasing cooperation amongst European states.

In the 21st Century, the Caledonian Philatelic Society also continues to flourish. It meets on Thursdays from October till April in Strathclyde University. Members are recognised for their knowledge and expertise throughout the philatelic world and new members are always made most welcome. We take pride in always showing a welcoming face and can guarantee anyone joining us a very fine evening, and never a fine mess.

## Hosting ASPS Annual Congress

The Association of Scottish Philatelic Societies (ASPS) is the association bringing together all the Philatelic Societies in Scotland. Each year a Congress is held in April and one of the member societies undertakes hosting, Usually the choice of year to host the congress ties in with some significant event related to that society. The Caledonian Philatelic Society hosted Congress, in recent years, in 1972, 1981, 1996 and 2016 on significant Society anniversaries. For each Congress, to raise funds, it is normal for Societies to produce special covers and the covers for the years above are shown below. There are also inserts which provide information and background to the anniversary, often tieing in to other significant anniversaries.

The covers produced, along with the inserts, are shown on the [Congress Covers page](./congress-covers).

## 110th Anniversary
2016 marked the 110th Anniversary of the founding of the Caledonian Philatelic Society in 1906. The Society hosted the Association of Scottish Philatelic Societies at the Dewar's Centre in Perth on April 15 and 16, 2016. Many different activities took place over the year as part of these Celebrations.

As is traditional many members exhibited samples of the wide collecting interests at the Host Society display. There was an opportunity to purchase souvenir covers and cards of events which shared the anniversary. King Robert II of Scotland was born in Paisley in 1316 while King James VI of Scotland and I of England was born in Edinburgh in 1566. Therefore their 700th and 450th Anniversaries occur in 2016. A cover showing images of Robert, Mary Queen of Scots and James VI/I was available for purchase and serviced covers were available after the Congress. A postcard celebrating the contribution of the King James Bible to the English language with a number of well-known sayings on the image side was also produced.

Dr Stewart Gardiner compiled a book entitled "Philatelic Witnesses to the Great War" (further detail is presented on the [Publications page](./publications)). This book reflected the fact that philatelists are responsible for accumulating items which throw light on aspects of the war which might otherwise be lost. Postcards and letters as well as patriotic labels are some examples of the material which is involved. Some of this material was exhibited at the Goethe Institute in Park Circus Glasgow during November and December 2015.

Joan Trew also produced a specially commissioned display which charted some of the events which happened during the latter part of the dynasty and events such as the Gunpowder Plot were illustrated by stamps and covers.
